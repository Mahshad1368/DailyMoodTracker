- Mood entries (mood type, date, time)
- Optional text notes
- Optional photos from your device
- Optional voice recordings

### How We Store Your Data
**All data is stored locally on your device only.** We do not:
- Upload your data to any servers
- Share your data with third parties

- Track your usage or behavior
- Collect any personal information

### Data You Control
You have complete control over your data:

These permissions are only used when you explicitly choose to add photos or voice recordings to your mood entries. You can deny these permissions and still use the core mood tracking features.

The home screen widget displays your most recent mood entry. This data is shared between the main app and the widget using Apple's secure App Group technology, which keeps your data on your device only.

## Third-Party Services

MoodFlex does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. We do not integrate with any external services or APIs.

We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to anyone. All data remains on your device.
